The flow of this project is that the user must go from one state to the next
The starting state static which shortly transitions to the seals
To go to the next state, a user must click on the seal playing the sax
Once the user clicks on the sax seal, they will move to the next state
To go to the last state, the user must click on the correct eye
Once they reach the last state, the DOM will wait for 5 seconds before refreshing, bringing the DOM back to its original state
Hopefully it looks like a loop is being played

Note that as the user moves from one state to the next, everything in the previous state gets removed from the DOM
