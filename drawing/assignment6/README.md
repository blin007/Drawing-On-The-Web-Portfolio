## Description
One of the most important aspects of designing a website is choosing an attractive color scheme. [Color API](https://www.thecolorapi.com/) has an id endpoint which can convert/identify a color, and a scheme endpoint which can generate a color scheme. This project explores the latter endpoint. The scheme endpoint gets a color scheme based on a given seed color. The resulting generated scheme is a multi-color combination chosen according to color-wheel relationships.  The scheme endpoint parameters include: hex color code, rgb color, hsl color, cmyk color, result format (JSON, SVG, HTML), mode, count, w, and named. For this project, I inputted a random rgb color and mode in the get request.
